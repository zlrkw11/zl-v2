This allows for dynamic routing in Next.js applications. Basic logic: reads blog from 'blogs' and get the data of the blog: title, date, text.. Then NEXT uses the .slug property to dynamically create the blogs/blog_1.tsx route. When we load into that new page, it uses the slug property to generate and render the contents shown on the page.",
